            <p>In an era of faster product cycles, global competition and increased risk of supply chain disruption, corporate leaders need to know how to use procurement–now often called supply management–as a competitive advantage. Purchasing and global sourcing can account for more than 50 percent of overall costs in many industries. </p>
